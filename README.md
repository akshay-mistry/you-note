# YouNote
Many people struggle to organize their busy lives between their assignments, jobs, and personal matters. Most people have multiple different applications on their phones storing notes, pictures, reminders, and personal thoughts. YouNote provides an efficient way to organize all of your resources into a customizable interface. YouNote allows for manual typing, Google Voice typing, and image uploads. By employing the Google Vision API to extract text from images, YouNote allows you to seamlessly convert grocery lists, book titles, class notes, and other types of images to normal text. In the future, YouNote will implement a cloud storage system to replace the current locally saved files.
